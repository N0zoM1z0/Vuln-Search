# Summary
There is a denial of service vulnerability in `ncc2` binary file of D-Link DIR830LA1_FW100B07.

Fimware download link : https://legacyfiles.us.dlink.com/DIR-830L/REVA/FIRMWARE/DIR-830L_REVA_FIRMWARE_1.00B07.ZIP

Affected component is `Qrs_setWebFilterSettings` and `WebsiteFilter.html`.

Notice: it also exists in **HotFix** version!

# Details
In function `Qrs_setWebFilterSettings`, here get parameter `NumberOfEntry` from user's input:

The following loop obtains the string according to the value of `NumberOfEntry` and assigns the value. There is no upper limit on NumberOfEntry. It should be limited to 15 according to the web page.

This results in us being able to change the value of `NumberOfEntry` to a large value after we capture the packet. According to the logic of the program processing, it feels more like an exception caused by out-of-bounds access?
According to my analysis, the a2 pointer is moved back each time, so that the string obtained each time is different:

Funtion `sub_46BF28`:

However, if we only pass a string, except for the first time, no string can be found afterwards, which means that the return value of `strstr` is 0 (NULL).
The program does not judge this situation, that is, whether the return value of strstr != 0, there is:
```
v2 = &v4[v7 + 1];
```

The initial value of v7 is 0, so even if we donâ€™t have a string, v2 will still move back 1 bit each time. If we pass a large number of times (99999999), it will cause an out-of-bounds access.

Front-end interface points:

We add a rule and use burpsuite to intercept the packet:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a158e0-1cda-4028-98a6-0655169a369b)

We change the `NumberOfEntry` to 99999999 and send:

It will get stuck for a long time:

After a while, we can curl and find that it has 500:
